# Beyond Core
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Beyond-Engine/Core.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Beyond-Engine/Core)
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/4fd4193gbuj65w0e?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/LesleyLai/core)

beyond::core is a library with a bunch of utilities that are associated with graphics and game programming.
It forms the core utilities of the [Beyond Game Engine](https://github.com/Beyond-Engine/Beyond-Game-Engine).
The library implements an ECS, a math library built for graphics programming, a thread pool, some customized containers,
and a bunch of utilities.

## Usage
This library is not in a usable state to the public yet.
The features are incomplete and are coded as need. I will also make breaking changes frequently.
However, it is solid enough that I use it in a bunch of my personal projects including
- [Beyond Game Engine](https://github.com/Beyond-Engine/Beyond-Game-Engine): My work-in-progress game engine
- [Vulkan-Renderer](https://github.com/LesleyLai/Vulkan-Renderer): My experiments with the Vulkan API
- [lesty](https://github.com/LesleyLai/lesty): An offline renderer
- [Yet-Another-Software-Rasterizer](https://github.com/LesleyLai/Yet-Another-Software-Rasterizer): A software rasterizer
- [Jumpy Thieves](https://github.com/cugdc/Jumpy-Thieves): A live-coded 2D game in my club
